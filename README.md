# Face Mask Detection Germany 🇩🇪

A simple AI project that uses OpenCV and a trained CNN model to detect face masks in real-time using webcam input.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `detect_mask.py` → Main code for mask detection
- `models/` → Folder to keep your trained Keras model (`mask_model.h5`)

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Install requirements:
```
pip install opencv-python tensorflow numpy
```

2. Put your trained model in the `models/` folder named `mask_model.h5`.

3. Run:
```
python detect_mask.py
```

## 💡 Note:
This is a student project built for M.Tech Germany applications.
